                <p>
                I am a computer science and a mathematics student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am currrently a senior and I am proficent
                in Java, C, Ruby and Javascript. I am interested in Computer Vision, mobile development, data science and machine learning. I have done work in 
                with Virtual Reality and how it can be used as an educational tool as a part of the FIRE program in UMD. In my internship at NTConcepts I was part of a team that created an object detection 
                model that took live video and displayed detected objects with bounded boxes and labels around them. In my internship in Geico I created a website that was intended 
                to be used by all the employees to determine their computer health as well as their application preformances.
