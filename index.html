                <p>
                I hold a degree in Computer Science with a strong emphasis on Mathematics from the University of Maryland. My technical skill set includes proficiency in programming languages such as Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript. 
                I have also gained substantial experience in working with cloud services like AWS and databases such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL.  
                Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity of working with large companies such as JPMorgan Chase & Co, GEICO, and NT Concepts. 
                These experiences have allowed me to improve my skills as a software developer but also contribute in a team and Agile environment. 
                I am now seeking a new opportunity and a new role as a Software Developer for a new company. 
                I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and continue my professional growth in a dynamic and supportive setting.
